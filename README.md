# Travel Trends in Singapore
This github repository consists of our machine learning project for module code INF2008.

## Problem Statement
This study aims to predict popular travel destinations during holidays and major events by analyzing air passenger departures and arrivals in Singapore. By examining historical flight data, passenger trends, and external factors such as public holidays and major global or regional events, this research seeks to identify patterns in travel behavior. Understanding these trends can provide valuable insights for airlines, travel agencies, and policymakers to optimize flight schedules, manage demand, and enhance tourism strategies. Additionally, this study will explore the influence of factors such as destination appeal to refine predictions and improve forecasting models.
